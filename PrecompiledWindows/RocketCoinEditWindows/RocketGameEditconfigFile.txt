READ ME for help configing

line 1, "t/f" is for configuration status (It won't work if it's set to "F/f", set it to "T/t")
-----
line 2, is the file path to look for your risk of rain 2 config folder (where the lunar coin value is located)
{linux}The defualt location is on linux in /home{current user}/.steam/steam/userdata/{your steamid}/632360/remote/UserProfiles/somenumbers.xml
{Windows}The defualt location on Windows is  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{your steamid}\632360\remote\UserProfiles/somenumbers.xml
-----
line 3, is how many coins your value will be set to. Just be aware that -2147483648 to 2147483647 are the lowe-
-st and largest this program (and risk of rain actually) will take.
