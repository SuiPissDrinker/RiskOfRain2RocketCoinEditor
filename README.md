# RiskOfRain2RocketCoinEditor
A simple Coin editor I made for risk of rain.
There's nothing to special about this, I just made this for fun. Maybe I'll make some actually good code sometime else.
I've provided precompiled binarys for both linux and windows, but there is a chance they might not work on your system, if that's the case, just compile it yourself ðŸ—¿
